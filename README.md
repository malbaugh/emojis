Free, open source emojis.

## Beautiful emoji artwork, free of charge
I am building a repository of free emojis. 

## Plans
I will be updating this periodically with new emojis, as I have the spare time to create them. 

## Suggestions
Please feel free to contact me to suggest new emojis or aesthetic tweaks you would like to see.

## Attribution 
I would appreciate credit for my artwork when you use it, but I don't require any specific attribution. 

## Bug Reports
Please create an issue via GitHub.
